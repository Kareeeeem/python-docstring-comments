# Python docstring comments

An addition to the python syntax highlighting to highlight docstrings as
comments.

It is taken from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16051080) answer on
[Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

## Installation

I recommend [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
